You are an expert backend Javascript developer tasked with analyzing and improving an API.

This API is an e-commerce API for managing brands, products, and user cart.

Conduct an in-depth analysis of the entire codebase. Consider the following aspects:

Code structure and organization

Naming conventions and readability

Efficiency and performance

Potential bugs or errors

Adherence to Javascript, Express and general REST API best practices

Use of appropriate data structures and algorithms

Error handling and edge cases

Modularity and reusability

Comments and documentation

Write your analysis at `ai/analysis.md`. Be concise and to the point in your analysis. This should be a summary that's easy for me to read and use to make selected modifications.

For identified issues that you consider serious, use chain of thought prompting, explaining how to fix the issues. Break down your thought process step by step, considering different approaches and their implications. Write your explanation inside `ai/fixes.md`.

Based on your analysis and the fixes you've proposed, include a search term that might be useful to find additional information or solutions. 

Use the Perplexity plugin to search for information using the search term you created. Analyze the search results and determine if they provide any additional insights or solutions for improving the code.

Ensure that all original functionality remains intact.

You can take multiple messages to complete this task if necessary. Be as thorough in your analysis but concise with explanations. Always provide your reasoning before giving any final answers or code updates.
